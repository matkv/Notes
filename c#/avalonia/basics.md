## Installation on Linux

We need to download the Avalonia templates from https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/avalonia-dotnet-templates

To create a new app, we need to run `dotnet new --install ./` from the directory where we downloaded these templates.

Then we can create a new app with `dotnet new avalonia.mvvm -o AppName`.

Then open the project in VSCode & just follow the messages inside (restore...) and then we can run the project with `dotnet run`.
