# Intepreter

A computer program that **directly executes instructions** written in a programming or scripting language **without requiring them to have been previously compiled**.

It does not translate the code in an executable file but it analyses it and directly runs it. The analysis of the source code happens at **runtime**.

They are generally platform independent, but slower than compiler languages.

Examples: 

* PHP
* Perl
* BASIC
* Ruby

Strategies used for program execution:

* **Parse** the source code and perform its behaviour directly
* **Translate** source code into some efficient immediate representation and immediately execute this
* Explicitly execute stored precompiled code made by a compiler which is part of the interpreter system.
