# Programming languages

## Types of programming languages

* Imperative
    * Consists of commands for the computer to perform. It uses statements to change a program's state.
    * Object-oriented languages
    * Sequences of commands
* Declarative
    * Focuses on *what* the program should do without specifying **how** the program should achieve the result.
    * Functional languages
    * The description of the problem is in the focus
    * Example - SQL


### Statically typed language

All expressions have their types determined prior to when the program is executed (typically at compile time).

### Dynamically typed language

The type safety is determined at run time. The types are associated with run time values. They do not require the programmer to write explicit type annotations on expressions.

### Weak typing

Weak typing allows a value of one type to be treated as another, for example treating a string as a number.

### Strong typing

Strong typing prevents that. An attempt to perform an operation on the wrong type of value raises an error. Strongly typed languages are sometimes called **safe**.

## Generations of programming languages

1. Machine language - Low level of abstraction.
2. Assembly language - Also low level,
