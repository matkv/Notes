# Programming languages

## Types of programming languages

* Imperative
    * Consists of commands for the computer to perform. It uses statements to change a program's state.    
    * Object-oriented languages
    * Sequences of commands that lead to a final result
    * Usage of statements that change a program's state
* Declarative
    * Focuses on *what* the program should do without specifying **how** the program should achieve the result. 
    * Functional languages
    * The description of the problem is in the focus
    * Example - SQL


### Statically typed language

All expressions have their types determined prior to when the program is executed (typically at compile time).

### Dynamically typed language

The type safety is determined at run time. The types are associated with run time values. They do not require the programmer to write explicit type annotations on expressions.

### Weak typing

Weak typing allows a value of one type to be treated as another, for example treating a string as a number.

### Strong typing

Strong typing prevents that. An attempt to perform an operation on the wrong type of value raises an error. Strongly typed languages are sometimes called **safe**.

## Generations of programming languages

1. **First generation:** Machine language - Low level of abstraction (binary code, 1's and 0's), can be exectued **directly by a computers's CPU**, no translator is needed to compile or assemble the language.
2. **Second generation:** Assembly language - Also low level, a very strong similarity between the instructions in the language and the architecture's machine code instructions - own assembly language which is designed for exactly one specific computer architecture.
3. **Third generation:** High level languages - higher abstractions, complex compilers, easier to read for humans. Many support object oriented programming. For example, C, C++, C# or Java.
4. **Fourth generation:** Macro & script languages - consist of statements similar to the human langauge. Tend to be specialized for very specific domains such as database management, mathematical optimization or web development. Examples: Perl, SQL
5. **Fifth generation:** Languages based on problem-solving using constraints given to the program rather than using an algorithm written by a programmer. They were designed to solve a given problem without a programmer. Mainly used in **artificial intelligence** research. Examples: OPS5 and Mercury.
