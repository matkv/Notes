# Algorithm

Clearly defined instructions for solving a problem. An algorithm is always clear - under the **same conditions** it always returns the **same result**.

Ways to represent an algorithm:

* natural language
* pseudo-code
* structogram
* flow chart

An algorithm is **doable**, **correct** and **efficient**.
