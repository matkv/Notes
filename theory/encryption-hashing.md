# Encryption, decryption & hashing

# Encryption

Encryption is the practice of scrambling information in a way that it can only be unscrambled with a corresponding key. Encryption is a **two-way** function - when we encrypt something, we do it with the intention of **decrypting** it later.

## Manual decryption methods

* Ceasar chiffre - letters are shifted in a certain way (left or right, example: A B C D E --->  C D E F G), very easy & unsafe
* Skytale - parchment roll wrapped around a stick of a certain diameter and written - can only be read with a stick with the exact same diameter
