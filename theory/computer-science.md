# Computer science

Automatic & systematic processing of information, especially with the help of computers.

* theoretical CS - abstract, math oriented
* technical CS - microprocessors, computer architecture
* practical CS - data structures, algorithms
* applied CS - applications in several areas

# Data vs. information

* Information - Knowledge about things or processes, an answer to a specific question
* Data - Information that is processed/saved. Systematic representation of data - used for presentation, storing and processing.

Information is more abstract and is represented by data.

# Problem solving

1. Problem -> analysing, splitting it up into sub-problems
2. Model -> coming up with an idea for a solution
3. Algorithm -> implementing the solution in a programming language
4. Sourcecode -> the compiler / interpreter translates the source code to machine code
5. Application -> execution of the program
6. Solution/Result
