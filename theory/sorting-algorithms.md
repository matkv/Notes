# Sorting algorithms

The **Big O notation** describes how slow an algorithm becomes once the complexity of the inputs rises. For example `O(nÂ²)` -> the execution times rises to the square in relation to the amount of inputs.

The lowest possible Big O notation is -> `O(1)`.

`O(n)` means the complexity rises in a constant/linear way.
